# Mow Grass Mo' Money — Concept Art Shot List

## Marketing / key art candidates
1) **Golden-hour stripe reveal**: mower mid-turn, satisfying clean lines, warm sun, cozy suburb backdrop.
2) **“From push mower to empire”**: lineup progression across the image (manual push → riding mower → trailer + crew).
3) **Garage HQ**: your small business base with upgrades visible (tools, shelves, trophy lawn awards, region map).

## Gameplay clarity concepts
4) **Obstacle language sheet**: sprinklers, toys, flower beds, rocks, hoses, water feature edges (with “avoid/slow/bonus” notes).
5) **Grass material sheet**: mowed/unmowed variations (stripe direction, wet vs dry, shade vs sun).
6) **Lawn layout thumbnails**: 12 small yard “puzzle” designs increasing in complexity.

## UI concepts
7) **Day planning screen**: customer cards, forecast, HOA rules, equipment loadout.
8) **Customer card set**: 8 archetypes (budget, eco-friendly, “quiet hours,” perfectionist, huge estate, etc.).
9) **Upgrade shop grid**: equipment tiers with big icons and simple stat deltas.
