# Mow Grass Mo' Money — Art Direction (v0)

## High-level vibe
Cozy, optimistic, “small business to empire” ambition. Everything should feel friendly and readable, even when the numbers get big, with somewhat muted tones for an indie-game feel.

## Style target (default)
Top-down 2D with painterly stylization:
- Clean, readable shapes with bold silhouette separation
- Hand-painted texture feel (subtle brush grain, not noisy)
- Soft baked lighting cues painted into sprites/tiles (no real-time PBR look)
- Selective outline/edge accents for gameplay readability
- Mostly muted, earthy colors with restrained saturation (save brighter accents for rewards/state changes)

If you want a different look, pick one and I’ll retune the boards/prompts:
- **More cozy-cartoon:** flatter shading + stronger color blocking
- **More grounded-illustration:** lower saturation + more natural material cues
- **Retro pixel variant:** chunkier forms + limited palette while preserving readability

## Readability rules (gameplay-first)
- Mowed vs unmowed grass must be unmistakable at a glance (pattern + value shift + highlight/texture change).
- Obstacles (sprinklers, toys, rocks, flower beds) need high silhouette contrast and clear collision language.
- Weather/HOA “noise” modifiers should be communicated via clear iconography and audio-visual feedback (e.g., “quiet hours” signage, subtle meter).

## Signature “grass language”
To make mowing satisfying, combine 3 cues:
1) **Stripe pattern** (directional texture strokes/tiles)
2) **Value shift** (mowed slightly darker/less saturated)
3) **Highlight behavior** (mowed areas catch painted highlight bands more cleanly)

## Camera & scale assumptions (for concept art)
- Camera: top-down gameplay-first framing, wide enough to plan clean lines and avoid obstacles.
- Scale: yards readable as “puzzle spaces” (beds/paths/trees as lanes and obstacles).
- Time of day: golden hour by default; overcast for PNW variant.

## Palette anchor (base game)
- Grass: #5F7F4E (mid), #3E5F38 (shadow), #87A96B (sun)
- Sky: #A9BCD0 (day), #D9A97E (golden hour)
- UI neutrals: #202327, #333941, #DDE3EA
- Accent “money/upgrade”: #D9B44A, #4FA57C

## Materials & shape language
- **Business/garage:** painted wood + corrugated metal + concrete, warm wear
- **Equipment:** readable color coding by tier; bold decals; simplified 2D forms
- **Suburb props:** fences, mailboxes, kiddie pools, grills, lawn gnomes (comedic but not cluttered)

## Characters (optional)
If characters appear, keep them stylized and friendly:
- Big readable heads/hands, simple facial features
- Workwear silhouettes (gloves, ear protection, cap)
- Diversity in age/body types across crew and customers
