# Repository Agent Notes

## Progress Log Requirement

- Keep `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/progress.md` up to date.
- Read it before starting meaningful work.
- Append a short factual entry after each meaningful change (implementation, behavior/UX tweak, verification run, bug fix, or documentation sync).
- Preserve prior history; do not rewrite old entries unless explicitly requested.
