Original prompt: Build a simple game based on the POC-Mowing.md directions. Keep the broader context in mind such as Summary.md. Place the game in a sub-folder.

- Parsed requirements from POC-Mowing.md and Summary.md.
- Decided scope: single-scene top-down mowing POC with mouse-hold movement, steering by cursor offset, obstacle collisions, mow coverage % and 95% win condition.
- Chosen implementation path: plain HTML/CSS/JS in `mowing-poc-game` for quick iteration.

- Created `mowing-poc-game` with `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `game.js`.
- Implemented single-lawn scene, mower movement, mouse steering, reverse, obstacle collisions, mow-state grid, coverage UI, and 95% completion condition.
- Exposed deterministic hooks: `window.render_game_to_text` and `window.advanceTime(ms)`.
- Next: run Playwright client loop, inspect screenshot/state, and fix any issues.

- Installed Playwright dependencies needed by `develop-web-game` skill client and downloaded Chromium runtime.
- Ran Playwright loop against `http://127.0.0.1:4173` with multi-step mouse input bursts.
- Reviewed generated screenshots in `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/mowing-poc-game/output/web-game`:
  - Mowed vs unmowed grass readability is clear and immediate.
  - Mower movement/steering/reverse interactions function and update coverage in real time.
  - Obstacles and lawn bounds block traversal as expected.
- Verified `render_game_to_text` outputs deterministic state snapshots (`state-0.json`..`state-2.json`) including coordinates, mower state, map obstacles, objective, and coverage.
- No console/page errors were generated by the Playwright client (no `errors-*.json` files emitted).

TODO / Next suggestions:
- Tune steering/speed values after hands-on play if you want a tighter or more arcade-like feel.
- Optional: add a simple time limit mode and medal score (coverage + time) while keeping this POC scope intact.
- Updated steering model in `mowing-poc-game/game.js` to use mouse X delta (left/right motion) instead of turning toward cursor position.
- Steering now works while stationary in `playing` mode; if mouse is not moved, mower maintains heading and drives straight.
- Added image-based mower rendering by integrating `mowing-poc-game/assets/mower-sheet.png`.
- Updated draw path in `mowing-poc-game/game.js` to render a selected sprite frame with rotation, with previous vector mower retained as fallback if image loading fails.
- Ran Playwright sprite sanity check and verified sprite appears in gameplay screenshot (`output/web-game-sprite-check/shot-0.png`).
- Increased mower steering sensitivity so each mouse move causes a higher turn rate (changed steer delta scaling from `/20` to `/10`).
- Added steering HUD slider (left-center-right) on canvas UI to visualize live steering input.
- Slider knob now reflects steering axis and recenters when mouse steering input stops.
- Exposed `input.steering_axis` in `render_game_to_text` for debugging parity with HUD.
- Changed steering to a persistent axis model: mouse movement now shifts steering left/right and steering holds when mouse stops moving.
- Removed auto-centering behavior; user must steer back toward center to neutralize turning.
- Switched steering back to mouse-follow mode (cursor-relative turning) instead of persistent steering axis.
- HUD steering slider now reflects live cursor-follow steering value again.
- Reworked collision response to be more forgiving with slide behavior.
- Added movement solver that advances to contact point, computes collision normal, and projects remaining movement along the surface.
- Reduced hard-stop feel by damping speed less aggressively on blocked movement.
- Increased mower turning sharpness by raising base `turnRate` from `2.3` to `3.4`.
- Increased grass mow chunk size by changing mow-grid cell size from `10` to `18` pixels (larger mowable chunks, easier coverage).
- Fixed mower sprite facing direction by flipping sprite heading offset from `+PI/2` to `-PI/2` so the mower points the correct way while moving.
- Added procedural background music using Web Audio API (no external audio files).
- Music starts on first user interaction and loops with a simple bass/pad pattern.
- Added mute toggle with `M` and HUD status text (`Music: On/Off`).
- Updated steering pivot model so heading rotates around a point near the mower front instead of center.
- Implemented front-pivot turn helper with collision-safe fallback to partial center rotation if blocked.
- Set music default to off by initializing `state.musicMuted` and `music.muted` to `true`.
- Added real grass sprite assets: `mowing-poc-game/assets/grass-unmowed.png` and `mowing-poc-game/assets/grass-mowed.png`.
- Updated `drawMowGrid()` to render per-cell grass via image sprites (with existing color fallback if images fail to load).
- Validated via Playwright screenshot: `mowing-poc-game/output/web-game-grass-sprites/shot-0.png`.
- Regenerated grass sprites per updated art direction:
  - `grass-mowed.png` is now a single flat tone (no stripe pattern).
  - `grass-unmowed.png` includes visible strand/blade texture.
- Verified in screenshot: `mowing-poc-game/output/web-game-grass-fix/shot-0.png`.

- Built text-first tycoon meta POC in new folder `tycoon-poc-text` with:
  - `index.html`, `styles.css`, `game.js`, and `README.md`.
  - Multi-day loop states: `planning` -> `performance` -> `report`.
  - Customer/job model including `pattern_preference` (`circle`/`stripe`/`none`).
  - Resolution math with quality multiplier, pattern modifier (+5% match / -5% mismatch except `none`), fuel + maintenance costs, churn + conversion handling, and upgrade purchasing (3 mower tiers).
  - Deterministic hooks: `window.render_game_to_text()` and `window.advanceTime(ms)`.

- Adjusted controls to be compatible with the Playwright skill client key map:
  - Planning: Up/Down cursor, Space toggle, Enter confirm.
  - Performance: Up/Down score, Left/Right cycle pattern, Enter resolve.
  - Report: `A` (or `U`) buy upgrade, Enter next day.

- Ran automated Playwright loop against `http://127.0.0.1:4174` and validated output artifacts in `tycoon-poc-text/output/web-game`:
  - Screenshots: `shot-0.png`..`shot-2.png`.
  - State snapshots: `state-0.json`..`state-2.json`.
  - State progression confirms day advancement and cash/upgrades changing across iterations (e.g., Day 2 -> Day 4, mower tier moved to `gas_push`).
  - No page error artifact files emitted.

TODO / Next suggestions:
- Add a dedicated seeded simulation mode endpoint (run N days without UI input) for faster economy balancing.
- Surface richer report details in `render_game_to_text` for direct assertion tests (per-job expected vs actual multipliers).
- Optionally port this text loop into the existing mowing POC as a pre/post-mow meta layer.
- Updated `tycoon-poc-text` layout orientation:
  - Console moved into left column.
  - Ongoing stats (canvas) moved into right panel with heading.
  - Added responsive breakpoint to stack panels on narrow screens.
- Verified app still renders and state output unchanged via Playwright artifacts in `tycoon-poc-text/output/web-game-layout`.

- Documentation sync for latest tycoon spec:
  - Updated `tycoon-poc-text/POC-Tycoon.md` to match current implementation.
  - Clarified current build target is browser-based text-first UI in `tycoon-poc-text`.
  - Updated interface spec to left-right workspace:
    - left console panel
    - right `Ongoing Stats` panel
    - right `Active Customers` panel below stats
  - Captured current controls:
    - Planning: Up/Down, Space, Enter
    - Performance: Up/Down, Left/Right, Enter
    - Report: A/U, Enter
    - Global: R, F
  - Captured implemented simulation features:
    - payout multipliers + pattern preference modifier
    - fuel/maintenance/net economy
    - retention/churn + new-customer conversion
    - 3-tier upgrades
    - deterministic hooks (`render_game_to_text`, `advanceTime`)

- UI updates reflected in spec:
  - Forced left-right panel orientation (no auto stack fallback).
  - Improved stats readability by resizing canvas rendering to panel size and increasing text scale.
  - Added `Active Customers` panel under stats with risk marker (`[risk]`) for delayed service.
- Updated tycoon customer acquisition flow:
  - Day 1 now starts with zero active repeat customers.
  - New customers are not auto-converted.
  - After resolving a day, passing new jobs (`final_score >= 70`) are shown as regular-customer offers in report phase.
  - Player can accept/decline offers (`Up/Down` + `Space`), and accepted offers are applied at next-day transition.
- Updated report controls and state payload:
  - Added offer cursor/selection handling in report mode.
  - Added `pending_regular_offers` in `render_game_to_text` payload.
- Updated docs/UI text for new controls and offer flow:
  - `tycoon-poc-text/index.html` hint text
  - `tycoon-poc-text/README.md`
  - `tycoon-poc-text/POC-Tycoon.md`
- Verification:
  - Playwright loop run: `tycoon-poc-text/output/web-game-offers`
  - Deterministic probe confirms offer lifecycle works:
    - report mode shows pending offers
    - accepting an offer adds repeat customer on next day
- Implemented day-action decision system in `tycoon-poc-text/game.js`:
  - New start-of-day phase: `day_action` with options `Solicit`, `Follow Up Leads`, `Mow Lawns`.
  - Day 1 now starts with zero active repeat customers.
- Added lead pipeline model:
  - `state.leads[]` persists across days with `lead_status` (`raw`/`qualified`).
  - `Solicit` generates probabilistic raw leads and charges random materials cost.
  - `Follow Up Leads` attempts to convert raw leads to qualified leads.
  - `Mow Lawns` planning list now pulls from qualified leads + repeat customers only.
- Updated mowing conversion lifecycle:
  - Lead jobs with passing score (`final_score >= 70`) become regular-customer offers in report.
  - Player accepts/declines offers in report; accepted offers become repeat customers next day.
  - Serviced leads are removed from lead pool after mowing.
- Updated report accounting:
  - Non-mow actions now produce end-of-day reports with `activity` and `materials` cost fields.
  - `render_game_to_text` now includes `leads`, `day_action`, and updated controls text.
- Updated UI/doc text:
  - `tycoon-poc-text/index.html` hint text updated for day-action flow.
  - `tycoon-poc-text/README.md` updated with day flow + controls.
  - `tycoon-poc-text/POC-Tycoon.md` updated to match lead-based acquisition design.
- Verification:
  - Playwright loop artifacts: `tycoon-poc-text/output/web-game-day-actions`.
  - Deterministic probe confirmed requested behavior:
    - `initial_repeat: 0`
    - `solicit_activity: solicit` with materials spend
    - mowing jobs sourced from leads (`mow_job_sources: ["lead", ...]`)
    - passing-grade offer appears and accepted offer becomes active repeat customer next day.
- Balancing tweak: reduced tycoon starting cash so day one begins below first mower upgrade cost.
  - Added `STARTING_CASH = 220` in `tycoon-poc-text/game.js`.
  - Applied value to initial state and reset path (`initialize()`).
- Note: attempted Playwright state verification was blocked by approval denial; code-level check confirms the configured value.
- Moved mower upgrade purchase from report phase into new day-action activity: `Shop for New Hardware`.
- `day_action` options now: `Solicit`, `Follow Up Leads`, `Mow Lawns`, `Shop for New Hardware`.
- Added `hardware_shop` mode:
  - `Up/Down` selects buy vs skip.
  - `Enter` confirms and ends the day.
  - Buying applies upgrade immediately and records `hardware_purchase`/`hardware_cost` in day report.
- Removed upgrade purchase keybinds from report mode.
- Updated docs/UI text:
  - `tycoon-poc-text/index.html`
  - `tycoon-poc-text/README.md`
  - `tycoon-poc-text/POC-Tycoon.md`
- Added timed processing transitions with spinner animation for time-consuming actions in `tycoon-poc-text/game.js`.
  - New transient mode: `processing` with animated spinner (`| / - \\`) and action label.
  - Added delays for:
    - `Solicit`
    - `Follow Up Leads`
    - transition to `Shop for New Hardware`
    - mowing result resolution (`performance` -> `report`)
    - hardware shop buy/skip confirmation
    - day advance (`report` -> next day)
- Input behavior updated:
  - While in `processing` mode, gameplay input is ignored (except reset/fullscreen handlers before mode checks).
- Verification:
  - `node --check tycoon-poc-text/game.js` passed.
  - `./tycoon-poc-text/scripts/verify-tycoon.sh http://127.0.0.1:4174` passed and produced updated artifacts under `tycoon-poc-text/output/verify-tycoon`.
- Verification workflow update:
  - `tycoon-poc-text/scripts/verify-tycoon.sh` now archives screenshots/state with global incremental numbering in creation order across runs.
  - Archive path: `tycoon-poc-text/output/verify-tycoon/snapshots`.
  - Added ordering guideline to `tycoon-poc-text/README.md`.
- Adjusted verification output indexing to match requested format.
  - `verify-tycoon.sh` now writes runs directly under `tycoon-poc-text/output` as:
    - `NN-web-game/`
    - `NN-probe.json`
  - Example: `01-web-game` + `01-probe.json`, then `02-*`, etc.
- Removed new nested numbering approach from the workflow; updated README guideline accordingly.
- Verification naming guideline update:
  - `verify-tycoon.sh` now names run folders/files as `NN-<change-label>-*`.
  - Label summarizes changes since the last successful verify baseline.
  - Falls back to `no-change` when no tracked changes are detected.
- Verification label tightening:
  - `verify-tycoon.sh` now generates shorter run labels meant to succinctly describe deltas since the previous verify run.
  - Preferred labels are compact categories (`gameplay`, `ui`, `docs`, `verify`) with file-based fallback and `no-change` when unchanged.
- Verification run:
  - Executed `./tycoon-poc-text/scripts/verify-tycoon.sh http://127.0.0.1:4174`.
  - Created indexed artifacts: `tycoon-poc-text/output/09-gameplay-ui-web-game` and `tycoon-poc-text/output/09-gameplay-ui-probe.json`.
  - Confirmed index-paired output structure remains intact.
- Day action UI readability update in `tycoon-poc-text/game.js`:
  - Added indented sub-description line under each day action row to summarize the current opportunity.
  - Sub-descriptions are dynamic (examples: raw leads available for follow-up, qualified+repeat jobs available for mowing, next hardware upgrade affordability).
- Verification:
  - Ran `./tycoon-poc-text/scripts/verify-tycoon.sh http://127.0.0.1:4174`.
  - New artifacts: `tycoon-poc-text/output/10-gameplay-web-game` and `tycoon-poc-text/output/10-gameplay-probe.json`.
- Added repo-local agent instruction file: `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/AGENTS.md`.
  - Includes explicit requirement to read and append `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/progress.md` after meaningful implementation, verification, or documentation changes.
- UI text spacing tweak in `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/game.js`:
  - Increased indentation for day-action subheader lines (both description + opportunity) to improve visual hierarchy.
- Verification:
  - Ran `./tycoon-poc-text/scripts/verify-tycoon.sh http://127.0.0.1:4174`.
  - Artifacts: `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/output/13-gameplay-web-game` and `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/output/13-gameplay-probe.json`.
- Balance adjustment in `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/game.js`:
  - Reduced lead qualification chance during `Follow Up Leads` from `0.6` to `0.4`.
- Verification:
  - Ran `./tycoon-poc-text/scripts/verify-tycoon.sh http://127.0.0.1:4174`.
  - Artifacts: `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/output/14-gameplay-web-game` and `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/output/14-gameplay-probe.json`.
- Refactor: split `tycoon-poc-text/game.js` into modular files under `tycoon-poc-text/src` with no intended behavior changes.
  - Added modules: `constants.js`, `state.js`, `stateMachine.js`, `jobs.js`, `dayActions.js`, `processing.js`, `keyboard.js`, `render/consoleView.js`, `render/statusPanel.js`, `render/activeCustomersView.js`, `index.js`.
  - Converted top-level `game.js` into a thin loader that imports `src/index.js`.
  - Centralized mode transitions via `stateMachine.js` (`transitionTo`/`forceMode`) to keep flow rules in one place.
- Docs update:
  - Added a `Code Structure` section to `tycoon-poc-text/README.md` describing the new module layout.
- Verification:
  - Ran `./tycoon-poc-text/scripts/verify-tycoon.sh http://127.0.0.1:4174`.
  - Artifacts: `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/output/15-gameplay-web-game` and `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/output/15-gameplay-probe.json`.
- Balance adjustment in `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/src/dayActions.js`:
  - Reduced `Solicit` lead generation chance from `0.68` to `0.45` to make lead acquisition harder.
- Verification:
  - Ran `./tycoon-poc-text/scripts/verify-tycoon.sh http://127.0.0.1:4174`.
  - Artifacts: `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/output/16-docs-web-game` and `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/output/16-docs-probe.json`.
- Input compatibility fix in `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/src/keyboard.js`:
  - Expanded selection key handling to accept `event.key === 'Space'` and `event.code === 'Space'` in addition to `' '` / `'Spacebar'`.
  - Applies to both planning job selection and report offer selection.
- Verification:
  - Ran `./tycoon-poc-text/scripts/verify-tycoon.sh http://127.0.0.1:4174`.
  - Artifacts: `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/output/17-keyboard-web-game` and `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/output/17-keyboard-probe.json`.
- Clarified lead-state wording in `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/src/render/consoleView.js`:
  - `Follow Up Leads` opportunity now shows `raw leads`.
  - `Mow Lawns` opportunity now shows `qualified leads`.
- Verification:
  - Ran `./tycoon-poc-text/scripts/verify-tycoon.sh http://127.0.0.1:4174`.
  - Artifacts: `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/output/18-consoleview-web-game` and `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/output/18-consoleview-probe.json`.
- Input flow update in `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/src/processing.js`:
  - Added optional `requireConfirm` parameter to `startProcessing` (default `true`).
  - When `requireConfirm` is `false`, processing now auto-runs `onComplete` after timer expiry instead of waiting for an extra Enter press.
- End-of-day transition update in `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/src/dayActions.js`:
  - Set `requireConfirm: false` for the `nextDay()` transition (`Advancing to next day...`) so returning to day action no longer needs a second Enter.
- Verification:
  - Ran `./tycoon-poc-text/scripts/verify-tycoon.sh http://127.0.0.1:4174` successfully.
  - Artifacts: `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/output/19-dayactions-web-game` and `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/output/19-dayactions-probe.json`.

  - `node --check /Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/src/dayActions.js` passed.
- Added RNG debug logging for lead generation/qualification rolls:
  - `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/src/dayActions.js` now logs solicit chance rolls and per-lead follow-up qualification rolls to browser console.
  - `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/src/jobs.js` now logs `randInt` rolls/results.
  - Added `DEBUG_ROLLS` toggle in `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/src/constants.js` (currently `true`).
- Verification:
  - Ran `./tycoon-poc-text/scripts/verify-tycoon.sh http://127.0.0.1:4174`.
  - Artifacts: `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/output/20-constants-web-game` and `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/output/20-constants-probe.json`.
- Replaced narrow debug flag with log-level categories:
  - Removed `DEBUG_ROLLS` and added `LOG_LEVEL` in `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/src/constants.js`.
  - Added `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/src/logging.js` with level-based logging (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, `NONE`).
  - Updated roll logging in `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/src/jobs.js` and `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/src/dayActions.js` to use `logDebug(...)`.
- Verification:
  - Ran `./tycoon-poc-text/scripts/verify-tycoon.sh http://127.0.0.1:4174`.
  - Artifacts: `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/output/21-constants-web-game` and `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/output/21-constants-probe.json`.
- Expanded RNG debug logging coverage in `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/src/jobs.js`:
  - `pick(...)` now logs roll, selected index, and selected value.
  - This completes debug logging for all random checks currently used in gameplay flow (`pick`, `randInt`, solicit chance, follow-up qualification chance).
- Verification:
  - Ran `./tycoon-poc-text/scripts/verify-tycoon.sh http://127.0.0.1:4174`.
  - Artifacts: `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/output/22-jobs-web-game` and `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/output/22-jobs-probe.json`.
- Debug visibility improvement in `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/src/dayActions.js`:
  - `Follow Up Leads` now logs a start summary with raw vs qualified counts.
  - When no raw leads exist, logs per-lead skip reasons (`status=qualified`) so users can see why no roll occurred.
- Verification:
  - Ran `./tycoon-poc-text/scripts/verify-tycoon.sh http://127.0.0.1:4174`.
  - Artifacts: `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/output/23-dayactions-web-game` and `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/output/23-dayactions-probe.json`.
- Added deterministic debug-log verification path:
  - `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/src/logging.js` now mirrors emitted logs into `window.__tycoonLogs` (ring buffer).
  - `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/src/index.js` now exposes `debug_log_tail` in `render_game_to_text()` payload.
  - `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/scripts/verify-tycoon.sh` now:
    - uses longer action waits so processing callbacks complete,
    - asserts debug roll logs are present (`debug_roll_logs_found: true`),
    - fails verification if no roll logs are found.
- Verification:
  - Ran `./tycoon-poc-text/scripts/verify-tycoon.sh http://127.0.0.1:4174`.
  - Artifacts: `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/output/24-verify-web-game` and `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/output/24-verify-probe.json`.

  - Startup `INFO` log on initialize.
  - Added `window.tycoonLogTest()` to emit INFO/DEBUG messages on demand and return recent buffered logs.
- Verification:
  - Ran `./tycoon-poc-text/scripts/verify-tycoon.sh http://127.0.0.1:4174`.
  - Artifacts: `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/output/25-index-web-game` and `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/output/25-index-probe.json`.
- Startup import mismatch fix in `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/game.js`:
  - Root cause: stale mixed ES module cache in Chrome could load mismatched versions (e.g., `logging.js` expecting `LOG_LEVEL` while cached `constants.js` lacked it).
  - Fix: added cache-busting query string to dynamic import of `src/index.js`.
- Verification:
  - Ran `./tycoon-poc-text/scripts/verify-tycoon.sh http://127.0.0.1:4174`.
  - Artifacts: `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/output/26-gameplay-web-game` and `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/output/26-gameplay-probe.json`.
- Input handling update in `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/src/keyboard.js`:
  - While `processing` mode is active, `Enter` now immediately completes the current processing step even before `awaitingConfirm`, allowing fast skip through progress screens.
- Console copy update in `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/src/render/consoleView.js`:
  - Processing phase now shows `Please wait... (Enter to skip)` before confirm-ready state.
- Verification:
  - Ran `./tycoon-poc-text/scripts/verify-tycoon.sh http://127.0.0.1:4174`.
  - Artifacts: `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/output/27-docs-web-game` and `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/output/27-docs-probe.json`.
- Day-action cursor persistence update in `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/src/dayActions.js`:
  - Removed end-of-day reset of `state.actionCursor` during `nextDay()` so returning to `day_action` keeps the previously selected action highlighted.
  - New-game/reset flow still initializes cursor to first action via core state reset.
- Verification:
  - Ran `node --check /Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/src/dayActions.js`.
  - Ran `./tycoon-poc-text/scripts/verify-tycoon.sh http://127.0.0.1:4174`.
  - Artifacts: `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/output/28-run-regression-tests-web-game` and `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/output/28-run-regression-tests-probe.json`.
- Regression framework upgrade for `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text`:
  - Added deterministic seed override support in `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/src/index.js` via URL query (`?seed=<int>`).
  - Added `seed` to `render_game_to_text()` payload.
  - Added test utility hooks in `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/src/index.js`:
    - `window.setTycoonSeed(seed)` to reset with explicit seed.
    - `window.__tycoonTestSetLeads({count,status})` for deterministic lead fixture setup in regression scenarios.
- Added deterministic regression runner:
  - New script `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/scripts/run-regression-tests.js`.
  - Implements 3 golden scenarios (`solicit_report`, `follow_up_report`, `mow_offer_accept`) with exact JSON baseline comparison.
  - Implements seed-matrix determinism check (runs each seed twice, requires identical summaries).
  - Writes summary artifact to `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/output/regression-tests/latest-summary.json`.
- Added deterministic seed-runner wrapper:
  - New script `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/scripts/run-seed-matrix.sh`.
- Added committed golden baselines:
  - `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/tests/golden/solicit_report.json`
  - `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/tests/golden/follow_up_report.json`
  - `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/tests/golden/mow_offer_accept.json`
- CI wiring:
  - Added `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/.github/workflows/tycoon-regression.yml` to run syntax check + regression suite on push/PR for `tycoon-poc-text/**`.
- Tooling + docs:
  - Added `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/package.json` and lockfile with Playwright dev dependency and regression scripts.
  - Updated `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/README.md` with deterministic seed usage + regression commands.
- Verification:
  - Ran `node --check /Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/scripts/run-regression-tests.js`.
  - Ran golden generation: `node /Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/scripts/run-regression-tests.js --url http://127.0.0.1:4174 --update-golden`.
  - Ran pass validation: `node /Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/scripts/run-regression-tests.js --url http://127.0.0.1:4174`.
- Output readability update in `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/src/index.js`:
  - Changed `render_game_to_text()` serialization to `JSON.stringify(payload, null, 2)` so Playwright-captured `state-*.json` files are pretty-printed.
- Verification:
  - Ran `node --check /Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/tycoon-poc-text/src/index.js`.
