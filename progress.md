Original prompt: Build a simple game based on the POC-Mowing.md directions. Keep the broader context in mind such as Summary.md. Place the game in a sub-folder.

- Parsed requirements from POC-Mowing.md and Summary.md.
- Decided scope: single-scene top-down mowing POC with mouse-hold movement, steering by cursor offset, obstacle collisions, mow coverage % and 95% win condition.
- Chosen implementation path: plain HTML/CSS/JS in `mowing-poc-game` for quick iteration.

- Created `mowing-poc-game` with `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `game.js`.
- Implemented single-lawn scene, mower movement, mouse steering, reverse, obstacle collisions, mow-state grid, coverage UI, and 95% completion condition.
- Exposed deterministic hooks: `window.render_game_to_text` and `window.advanceTime(ms)`.
- Next: run Playwright client loop, inspect screenshot/state, and fix any issues.

- Installed Playwright dependencies needed by `develop-web-game` skill client and downloaded Chromium runtime.
- Ran Playwright loop against `http://127.0.0.1:4173` with multi-step mouse input bursts.
- Reviewed generated screenshots in `/Users/zkendall/projects/MowGrassMoMoney/mowing-poc-game/output/web-game`:
  - Mowed vs unmowed grass readability is clear and immediate.
  - Mower movement/steering/reverse interactions function and update coverage in real time.
  - Obstacles and lawn bounds block traversal as expected.
- Verified `render_game_to_text` outputs deterministic state snapshots (`state-0.json`..`state-2.json`) including coordinates, mower state, map obstacles, objective, and coverage.
- No console/page errors were generated by the Playwright client (no `errors-*.json` files emitted).

TODO / Next suggestions:
- Tune steering/speed values after hands-on play if you want a tighter or more arcade-like feel.
- Optional: add a simple time limit mode and medal score (coverage + time) while keeping this POC scope intact.
- Updated steering model in `mowing-poc-game/game.js` to use mouse X delta (left/right motion) instead of turning toward cursor position.
- Steering now works while stationary in `playing` mode; if mouse is not moved, mower maintains heading and drives straight.
- Added image-based mower rendering by integrating `mowing-poc-game/assets/mower-sheet.png`.
- Updated draw path in `mowing-poc-game/game.js` to render a selected sprite frame with rotation, with previous vector mower retained as fallback if image loading fails.
- Ran Playwright sprite sanity check and verified sprite appears in gameplay screenshot (`output/web-game-sprite-check/shot-0.png`).
- Increased mower steering sensitivity so each mouse move causes a higher turn rate (changed steer delta scaling from `/20` to `/10`).
- Added steering HUD slider (left-center-right) on canvas UI to visualize live steering input.
- Slider knob now reflects steering axis and recenters when mouse steering input stops.
- Exposed `input.steering_axis` in `render_game_to_text` for debugging parity with HUD.
- Changed steering to a persistent axis model: mouse movement now shifts steering left/right and steering holds when mouse stops moving.
- Removed auto-centering behavior; user must steer back toward center to neutralize turning.
- Switched steering back to mouse-follow mode (cursor-relative turning) instead of persistent steering axis.
- HUD steering slider now reflects live cursor-follow steering value again.
- Reworked collision response to be more forgiving with slide behavior.
- Added movement solver that advances to contact point, computes collision normal, and projects remaining movement along the surface.
- Reduced hard-stop feel by damping speed less aggressively on blocked movement.
- Increased mower turning sharpness by raising base `turnRate` from `2.3` to `3.4`.
- Increased grass mow chunk size by changing mow-grid cell size from `10` to `18` pixels (larger mowable chunks, easier coverage).
- Fixed mower sprite facing direction by flipping sprite heading offset from `+PI/2` to `-PI/2` so the mower points the correct way while moving.
- Added procedural background music using Web Audio API (no external audio files).
- Music starts on first user interaction and loops with a simple bass/pad pattern.
- Added mute toggle with `M` and HUD status text (`Music: On/Off`).
- Updated steering pivot model so heading rotates around a point near the mower front instead of center.
- Implemented front-pivot turn helper with collision-safe fallback to partial center rotation if blocked.
- Set music default to off by initializing `state.musicMuted` and `music.muted` to `true`.
- Added real grass sprite assets: `mowing-poc-game/assets/grass-unmowed.png` and `mowing-poc-game/assets/grass-mowed.png`.
- Updated `drawMowGrid()` to render per-cell grass via image sprites (with existing color fallback if images fail to load).
- Validated via Playwright screenshot: `mowing-poc-game/output/web-game-grass-sprites/shot-0.png`.
- Regenerated grass sprites per updated art direction:
  - `grass-mowed.png` is now a single flat tone (no stripe pattern).
  - `grass-unmowed.png` includes visible strand/blade texture.
- Verified in screenshot: `mowing-poc-game/output/web-game-grass-fix/shot-0.png`.

- Built text-first tycoon meta POC in new folder `tycoon-poc-text` with:
  - `index.html`, `styles.css`, `game.js`, and `README.md`.
  - Multi-day loop states: `planning` -> `performance` -> `report`.
  - Customer/job model including `pattern_preference` (`circle`/`stripe`/`none`).
  - Resolution math with quality multiplier, pattern modifier (+5% match / -5% mismatch except `none`), fuel + maintenance costs, churn + conversion handling, and upgrade purchasing (3 mower tiers).
  - Deterministic hooks: `window.render_game_to_text()` and `window.advanceTime(ms)`.

- Adjusted controls to be compatible with the Playwright skill client key map:
  - Planning: Up/Down cursor, Space toggle, Enter confirm.
  - Performance: Up/Down score, Left/Right cycle pattern, Enter resolve.
  - Report: `A` (or `U`) buy upgrade, Enter next day.

- Ran automated Playwright loop against `http://127.0.0.1:4174` and validated output artifacts in `tycoon-poc-text/output/web-game`:
  - Screenshots: `shot-0.png`..`shot-2.png`.
  - State snapshots: `state-0.json`..`state-2.json`.
  - State progression confirms day advancement and cash/upgrades changing across iterations (e.g., Day 2 -> Day 4, mower tier moved to `gas_push`).
  - No page error artifact files emitted.

TODO / Next suggestions:
- Add a dedicated seeded simulation mode endpoint (run N days without UI input) for faster economy balancing.
- Surface richer report details in `render_game_to_text` for direct assertion tests (per-job expected vs actual multipliers).
- Optionally port this text loop into the existing mowing POC as a pre/post-mow meta layer.
